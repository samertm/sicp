The procedure is applied five times when (sine 12.15) is evaluated.

(sine 12.15)

(p (sine 4.05))

(p (p (sine 1.349)))

(p (p (p (sine .45))))

(p (p (p (p (sine .15)))))

(p (p (p (p (p .05)))))

For (pow a), the number of steps and the growth in space is n, where n = ln(a / 3)

a / 3^n = 1
a = 3^n
ln(a) = n * ln(3)
n = ln(a / 3)
